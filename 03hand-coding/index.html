        <h1>Current State</h1>
        <p>
            There are <strong>many current electric vehicles on the market,</strong> with many more on their way. In the last 5-10 years, electric vehicles have been gaining
            more and more traction then ever before. EV's (Eletric Vehicles) initially had a few runs starting in the 1990's, specifically in the United States GM produced their
            first electric car named General Motors EV1. This was the first mass-produced electric vehicle of the modern era, from any major automaker. Unfortunetely, 
            this vehicle was canceled due to the fear not making enough profit in the EV market. Since then, specifically the 2010's, EV's have been getting more and more popular,
            especially ramping up in the 2020's.

        <h2>Why Electric Vehicles?</h2>
            <p>EV's have many benefits over ICE (gasoline) vehicles. Including zero emissions, electric vehicles have increased
                torque, quieter, tend to have lower maintenance and any costs that come from that, and smoother acceleration and deceleration.
